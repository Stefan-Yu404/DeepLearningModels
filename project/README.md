# CS 449 Final Project

This repository should contain everything you need for us to grade your final
project, with the exception of any datasets that are larger than 50 MB. The
project has three main pieces:

- your proposal in `proposal.ipynb`, due February 1
- your project update in `update.ipynb`, due February 24
- your final report in `report.ipynb`, due March 13

As of January 24, we have provided templates for `proposal.ipynb` and
`update.ipynb`, but not `report.ipynb`. By each deadline, make sure your
finished `ipynb` file is pushed to GitHub. For each `ipynb`, please
include a PDF printout of it as well.
